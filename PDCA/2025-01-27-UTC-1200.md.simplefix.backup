# PDCA Cycle 3: Fix Relative Path Calculation

**Date**: 2025-01-27 UTC 12:00
**Role**: OntologyAgent  
**Task**: Correct relative path calculation for Atlassian link resolution

## Plan

### **Objective**
Fix the relative path calculation in the link update script to generate correct paths relative to the repository root.

### **Scope**
- Analyze current incorrect path: `../../../../../2cu.atlassian.net/...`
- Correct calculation to generate proper paths like `./2cu.atlassian.net/...`
- Update all affected files with correct relative paths
- Verify navigation works properly

### **Issue Identified**
Current links have excessive `../` levels because the path calculation is relative to each file's location instead of being properly calculated from the repository root.

### **Target Result**
Transform:
```
FROM: [Sprint characteristics](../../../../../2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/81133583/Sprint_characteristics.md)
TO:   [Sprint characteristics](./2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/81133583/Sprint_characteristics.md)
```

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Correct relative path calculation algorithm
- [ ] All files updated with proper short paths
- [ ] Links work correctly from any file location
- [ ] No excessive `../` sequences

## Do

### Actions Taken
1. **Analysis of Current Issue**
   - Repository root: `/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/`
   - Target folder: `2cu.atlassian.net/` (in repo root)
   - Current paths have too many `../` levels

2. **Path Calculation Fix**
   - Files should reference `./2cu.atlassian.net/...` or `2cu.atlassian.net/...` 
   - Need to calculate path relative to repo root consistently

## Check

### **User Feedback (Verbatim)**
"nearly perfect.
you need to link relative to /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/

so linkin to /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/2cu.atlassian.net 
is not 
[Sprint characteristics](../../../../../2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/81133583/Sprint_characteristics.md)

too many ../../
do another pdca to fix this."

### **Current State Analysis**
- Links generated with complex relative paths
- Should use simple paths from repo root
- Need to fix calculation algorithm

## Act

### **Immediate Fix Required**
Create corrected update script with proper path calculation.
