# PDCA Cycle 6: Dual-Context Entry Points for Complete Navigation

**Date**: 2025-01-27 UTC 14:00
**Role**: OntologyAgent  
**Task**: Solve dual-context navigation issue with .entry.md architecture

## Plan

### **Objective**
Create dual entry point system to solve context-dependent link navigation issues discovered by user.

### **Problem Identified by User**
**Current Broken State:**
1. **✅ Pages Context**: Navigation works perfectly within pages structure
2. **❌ Original Context**: Links broken when accessing from original symlink location
3. **Issue**: scrum.md (symlink) → points to pages, but links in pages expect pages context

**User's Example:**
```
/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/.../scrum.md → [Sprint characteristics](./2cu.atlassian.net/...)
```
- **From Pages**: Works (correct relative context)
- **From Original**: Broken (wrong relative context - needs ../../../../../)

### **User's Brilliant Solution**
- **Dual Entry Points**: 
  - `scrum.md` → symlink to pages (for pages context)
  - `scrum.entry.md` → original content with original relative paths (for original context)
- **Context-Appropriate Links**: Each entry point has links that work from its location

### **Scope**
- **Target Files**: All 217 files that were converted to symlinks
- **Dual Architecture**: 
  - `.md` files → symlinks to pages (pages context)
  - `.entry.md` files → original content with original relative links (original context)
- **Synchronization**: Strategy for keeping both files synchronized on updates

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] All original locations have `.entry.md` files with working original relative links
- [ ] All `.md` symlinks continue working in pages context
- [ ] Clear naming convention: `scrum.entry.md` (original context), `scrum.md` (pages symlink)
- [ ] Synchronization strategy documented and implemented
- [ ] Navigation works from both entry points

## Do

### **User Feedback (Verbatim)**
"1. links in /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/governance/eam/business-processes/bp-agile-workflow-management/scrum.md work perfectly inthe page structure, but are broken from this iexact path. 
2. the file is a link so once in the pages structure all work. but from this exact location it will not work.
3. /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/governance/eam/business-processes/bp-agile-workflow-management/scrum.md.migration.backup has still the corect relative links, but is not an md file.
4. so we need still both entry points sadly.
5 in a cleandup structure the name should be scrum.entry.md instead of scrum.md.migration.backup.

in a next phase we need to care how to keep the scrum.md and the scrum.entry.md in sync on changes on either side...."

### **My Planned Cleanup - INADEQUATE**
From PDCA Cycle 2, I planned this naive cleanup:
```bash
for f in $(find . -name '*.backup'); do mv "$f" "${f%.backup}"; done
rm -rf 2cu.atlassian.net/
```
**This would have been DISASTROUS** - would have destroyed the entire pages structure!

### **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Preserve Migration Backups**: Don't delete them, rename them properly
2. **Create .entry.md Files**: Use migration backups as source for original context
3. **Maintain Symlinks**: Keep current symlink architecture for pages context
4. **Document Sync Strategy**: Plan for dual-file synchronization

## Check

### **Current State Analysis**
- ✅ **Pages Structure**: Working perfectly (symlinks + clean relative paths)
- ✅ **Original Symlinks**: Working for content access
- ❌ **Original Context Navigation**: Links broken (point to pages context)
- ✅ **Migration Backups**: Contain original relative links (perfect source!)

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Data Safety**: Migration backups provide perfect source for .entry.md files
- **Complexity**: Dual-file architecture needs careful synchronization planning
- **User Experience**: Will provide seamless navigation from both contexts

## Act

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Create Dual Entry Script**: Convert .migration.backup → .entry.md with proper naming
2. **Preserve Symlink Architecture**: Keep current pages structure working
3. **Document Sync Strategy**: Plan for maintaining both file types
4. **Test Both Contexts**: Verify navigation from original and pages locations

### **Next Steps**
- Execute dual entry point creation
- Implement synchronization strategy
- Document maintenance procedures
- Complete navigation testing

### **Key Insight**
User identified that my PDCA planning was incomplete - I missed the fundamental dual-context navigation requirement. This cycle addresses the sophisticated architecture needed for complete navigation support.

**Status**: PDCA Cycle 6 - Planning dual-context architecture to solve user's navigation issue  
**Previous Issue**: My cleanup planning was inadequate for dual-context requirements
