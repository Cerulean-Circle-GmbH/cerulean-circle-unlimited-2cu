# PDCA Cycle: Atlassian Link Resolution for Cerulean Circle Unlimited 2CU Export

**Date**: 2025-01-27 UTC 10:45
**Role**: OntologyAgent  
**Task**: Systematic resolution of broken Atlassian links in Confluence export

## Plan

### **Objective**
Convert all Atlassian links in the exported Confluence repository to relative local markdown links, ensuring seamless navigation within the local repository structure.

### **Scope**
- **Target Repository**: `/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu`
- **Files to Analyze**: All `.md` files containing Atlassian links
- **Link Types**: 
  - Wiki page links: `https://2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/[ID]/[Title]`
  - Jira links: `https://2cu.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa`
  - General links: `https://2cu.atlassian.net/l/c/[ID]`

### **Targets (metrics)**
- 100% of Atlassian links converted to local references
- Zero broken links after conversion
- Preserve semantic meaning of all cross-references

### **Inputs**
- Exported Confluence repository structure
- Index.md with complete file mapping
- Original Atlassian URLs and their patterns

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] All Atlassian URLs identified and catalogued
- [ ] Corresponding local files located for each URL
- [ ] URL-to-file mapping structure created
- [ ] Symbolic links established
- [ ] All markdown files updated with relative links
- [ ] Navigation verified to work locally

### **Assumptions**
- All Confluence content has been successfully exported to local files
- File names in export correspond to page titles (with URL encoding)
- Directory structure reflects Confluence space organization
- Index.md provides complete and accurate file mapping

### **Constraints**
- Cannot modify existing file names or directory structure
- Must preserve all semantic cross-references
- Solution must work with standard markdown viewers
- Cannot access original Atlassian instance for verification

### **Options Considered**

**Option A: Direct URL replacement**
- Pros: Simple, fast implementation
- Cons: Requires exact file name matching, may break if export naming differs

**Option B: Mapping table approach**
- Pros: Flexible, handles naming differences, auditable
- Cons: More complex setup, requires manual verification

**Option C: Symbolic link directory structure (Selected)**
- Pros: Preserves URL structure, easy to maintain, transparent mapping
- Cons: Platform-specific (Unix/Linux/macOS), requires filesystem support

### **Rationale for Selected Option**
Symbolic link approach chosen because:
1. Preserves original URL structure for easy maintenance
2. Allows gradual migration with fallback mechanisms
3. Transparent mapping that's easy to understand and debug
4. Supports both exact and fuzzy matching for file location

### **Risks and Mitigations**
- **Risk**: Files not found for some URLs
  - **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive search strategy including fuzzy matching
- **Risk**: Symbolic links not supported on all platforms
  - **Mitigation**: Document platform requirements and provide alternatives
- **Risk**: Circular references or complex link structures
  - **Mitigation**: Implement link validation and cycle detection

## Do

### Actions Taken
1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Created PDCA folder structure
   - Analyzed initial sample file (scrum.md) to understand link patterns
   - Read OntologyAgent process for PDCA compliance

2. **Link Pattern Identification**
   - Identified three main Atlassian link types in scrum.md
   - Documented URL structure patterns
   - Planned extraction strategy using grep/rg tools

### Commands Executed
```bash
cd /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu
find . -name "*.md" | head -50
```

### Current Progress
- [x] PDCA structure established
- [x] Process documented
- [ ] Complete link extraction
- [ ] File mapping creation
- [ ] Symbolic link structure implementation
- [ ] Link updates

## Check

### **User Feedback (Verbatim)**
"we have to work on this repository.
/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu

read this file for example:
/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/governance/eam/business-processes/bp-agile-workflow-management/scrum.md

it contains backlinks to attlassian. 
the repo is an md export.
but it oly should have links to local md files.

read /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/index.md to see.

all content is exported to this repo, but the links will be broken. we have to fix them one by one.
my suggestion is to cretae a folder
/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/2cu.atlassian.net

and create in it the folder structure from e.g this link
[Sprint characteristics](../2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/81133583/Sprint_characteristics.md)

and change it to 
[Sprint characteristics](./2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/81133583/Sprint+characteristics)
81133583 shoud be a symbolic link to the exported file Sprint+characteristics in the 
real /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu folder. the problem is that we have to find it first in the repo. create yourslef a tree cmd output to reuse and quickly guess from.

read the pdca process from the /Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/scrum.pmo/roles/OntologyAgent
and run pdca cycles to resolve all links.

write your pdca enties into
/Users/Shared/Workspaces/2cuGitHub/Web4Articles/workspacesMountPoint/2cuGitHub/cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/PDCA"

### **Current Analysis Results**

**Sample Link Patterns Found in scrum.md:**
```
[Sprint characteristics](../2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/81133583/Sprint_characteristics.md)
[Definition of DONE](../2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/119111681/Definition_of_DONE.md)
[Scrum Teams](../2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/88211457/Scrum_Teams.md)
```

**Repository Structure Analysis:**
- Total markdown files: 50+ identified in initial scan
- Index.md contains comprehensive file mapping
- Files organized by business domains (governance, product, customer, etc.)
- Naming convention uses URL-encoded titles

### **Issues Identified**
1. Multiple link formats requiring different handling strategies
2. Need to establish file search methodology for accurate mapping
3. Require comprehensive extraction before creating folder structure

### **Evidence Snippets**
- Successfully created PDCA framework in target directory
- Identified clear link patterns in sample file
- Repository structure understood from index.md analysis

## Act

### **Next Steps**
1. **Complete Link Extraction**
   - Use grep/rg to find all Atlassian links across repository
   - Categorize links by type (wiki, jira, general)
   - Create comprehensive URL catalog

2. **File Location Strategy**
   - Implement fuzzy search for page titles in repository
   - Create mapping table of URLs to local file paths
   - Handle special characters and URL encoding

3. **Folder Structure Implementation**
   - Create `2cu.atlassian.net` directory with full URL path structure
   - Generate symbolic links for each identified file
   - Test link resolution

4. **Link Updates**
   - Replace Atlassian URLs with relative local paths
   - Validate all updated links work correctly
   - Commit changes with full documentation

### **Process Improvements**
- Implement automated link validation checks
- Create reusable scripts for similar export scenarios
- Document patterns for future Confluence migrations

### **Success Metrics Tracking**
- Links found: TBD (pending extraction)
- Files mapped: TBD (pending search)
- Links converted: 0/TBD
- Broken links remaining: TBD
