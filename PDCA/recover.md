# üîÑ **RECOVERY DOCUMENTATION**

**Last Update**: 2025-01-28 UTC 01:00  
**Current Branch**: feat/linksMigrated (OUTDATED) ‚ö†Ô∏è  
**Recovery Branch**: **ALWAYS USE MAIN BRANCH** ‚ö†Ô∏è  

## **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: THIS BRANCH IS OUTDATED**

### **IMMEDIATELY SWITCH TO MAIN BRANCH**
```bash
# REQUIRED - Switch to main branch NOW:
cd /workspace
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**Why**: This feat/linksMigrated branch contains experimental code from PDCA Cycles 1-9. The main branch has the complete production system with all 251 files migrated and is actively maintained.

## **üö´ DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH**

This branch contains:
- ‚ùå Only 29 test files (incomplete migration)
- ‚ùå Outdated maintenance scripts (v1.0)
- ‚ùå No auto-synchronization
- ‚ùå No user documentation
- ‚ùå Experimental code only

## **‚úÖ USE MAIN BRANCH INSTEAD**

The main branch contains:
- ‚úÖ 251 files fully migrated
- ‚úÖ Maintenance v2.0 tools
- ‚úÖ Auto-synchronization
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation
- ‚úÖ Self-healing repository

## **üéØ Correct Recovery Process**

1. **Switch to main immediately**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Read main branch recovery docs**:
   ```bash
   cat PDCA/recover.md
   ```

3. **Use production tools**:
   ```bash
   ./maintenance/v2.0/sync.sh
   ./maintenance/v2.0/test/health_check.sh
   ```

## **üìã Historical Context Only**

This branch was used for experimental development of:
- Initial dual-context architecture design
- Testing with 29 governance files
- Developing maintenance v1.0 scripts
- Git-based rollback strategy planning

All successful experiments have been integrated and improved in the main branch.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è If You Accidentally Started Here**

```bash
# Fix immediately:
git stash                    # Save any changes
git checkout main           # Switch to production
git pull origin main        # Get latest
cat PDCA/recover.md         # Read correct docs
```

---

**CRITICAL**: Do not continue on this branch. All work should be done on main.  
**Recovery Instruction**: "git checkout main && cat PDCA/recover.md"
