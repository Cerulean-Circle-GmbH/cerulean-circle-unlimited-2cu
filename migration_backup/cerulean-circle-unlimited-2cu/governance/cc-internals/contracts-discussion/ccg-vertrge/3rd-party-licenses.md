# neo4j

Neo4j is committed to open source. [Neo4j Community Edition](https://neo4j.com/download-center/#community) is [fully open source](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j), licensed and distributed under [GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html).

### Neo4j Community Edition

Neo4j Community is a fully featured, best-in-class graph database that uses the [GPL v3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html). We chose GPL because it means that Neo4j Community Edition can be used for free with your project: whether in the cloud or behind the firewall. If you’re building an application that accesses a Neo4j database running inside your organization (or on any personal device), then you are free to use Community Edition, whether or not your software is closed source.

### Neo4j Enterprise Edition

Neo4j Enterprise is designed for commercial deployments where scale and availability are important. To use Neo4j Enterprise, select the licensing option that best matches your needs:

# keycloak

permission:

- Commercial use
- Modification
- Distribution
- Patent use
- Private use

[https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)

Keycloak is Open Source Software licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. There are no costs if you want to use the software, but there is also no support for Keycloak.

If you are looking for official Support from Red Hat, then you can buy a commercial support subscription and use the product called “Red Hat SSO”, which is completely based on Keycloak, but comes with support, an SLA and patches/fixes. At the same time, you have to fulfill the requirements (environment, database, etc.) on how to run RH-SSO to get support.
