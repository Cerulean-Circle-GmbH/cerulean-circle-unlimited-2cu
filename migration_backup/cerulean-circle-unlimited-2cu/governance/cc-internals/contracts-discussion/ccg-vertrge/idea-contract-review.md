Contracts

1. technology license agreement

Licensee IDEA  
Licensor CCG

A.  
define: launching

  
redefine mission statement: "the purposes of creating a based Digital Asset (DA) utilizing 5 Use-Journeys set forth in the Deliverables"  
change: "5 Use Journey"  
add "**Deliverables**" as attachment

1.1 we can only speak for German / EU IP rights which might be the same

1.2 **licensed material** means the delivery that was programmed solemnly for this contract ("neompoc")

1.3 **software:** is 3rd party software that needs to be licensed additionally **OK?**

RIGHTS (the term company is used wrongly, it should be "licensor")

2.1 The licensor grants the licensee for the "created software" a perpetual worldwide license

2.2 The licensor offers the end-user a yearly subscription offering for to use closed source programs aka the licensed material, that needs to be purchased/obtained at "Cerulean Circle GmbH" (we do not know what kind of licenses are already owned by the end customer)

2.3 3rd party licenses need to be available at the user of the software according to their (3rd party) license terms.

i.e. 3rd party licenses need to be provided from the end customer on the respective site

4.1.a some licenses need to be aquired separatedly, see 3rd party software, "licensed material" sold is free of the rights others, caveat, can only be run with a license of woda framework.

5.1 CCG can only guarantee that the Framework aka WODA Kernel and the delivered "licensed material" is free of the rights others, this can not be done for the used 3rd party components. (Operating System, Database)

6.2. can it be clrified why this paragraph is needed? Using NEOM as a reference is one of our key retainers?

7.3 how can a perpetual license be terminanted? what is the impact of a termination? can CCG  then continue with business with NEOM? As we know the license is valid for one year and can be cancelled, the "licensed material" is sold to the customer and can not be cancelled. CAn we clarify this for my understanding?

Governing Law: We are a German company and out Jurisdiction shall be Germany? Suggestions? (also see WAIVER and Comliance with laws)

1. development and service agreement

Company: IDEA

Developer: CCG

Technology License Agreement refers to this one in circles, problem?

**RECITALS**

definition "Platform" might be incorrect, what is agreed is a feature cut subset of the 5 customer journeys "creating a fully functional state-of-the-art 3D immersive metaverse platform based Digital Asset (DA) utilizing 5 Use-Journeys set forth in the Deliverables (defined below)"

document "deliverables" are missing -> Content is in Exibit A as referenced later

“**License Agreement**” see above

definition of "to offer its applications and services" must be ammended that "services" are provided on additional efforts

services might need clarification or definition // responsibilities

definition needed of "or as otherwise agreed to by the parties "

1.1.b responsible for coordination meetings is IDEA

1.2 purpose of this paragraph unclear

1.3 a it is only what was agreed in the SoW document, everything else needs to be discussed under change management in a written form, signed and accepted by both

1.3.b we provide access to the cloud storage where this is stored

1.3 c see 1.3 a

1.4 might it be acceptable, since we are in a "feature cut" "timeboxed" PoC, we only deliver as Documentation the raw excerpt from development cloud storage servers, that can be taken as needed.

Exibit B

The presentation is not being weighted in the development sprint of the PoC and therefore needs to be funded differently.

2.2 (a) please specify how "Company" will review inspect and evaluate the delivery, so this can be taken into account.

2.2 (b) the poc is featurecut and timeboxed, you are invited to join development sessions to activly interact with development to specify your needs

2.2  (c) since we are not working as waterfall, changed to the progress can not be accepted after the poc but while the poc. so please involve yourself into the development process progress

3.1 (a) After a poc will be no support period, the poc is working or not. developer can not take over the risk of fixing bugs that might be essential by understanding of developer and company. therefore the poc is timeboxed and featurecut. we need to align to come here to a result. developer can not take the risk

3.2 (b) Platform of acceptance will be the test platform of [cavern.us](http://cavern.us) and developer. there will be no installation in the premisis of "NEOM". if wanted this can be done by change request. There will be no fixes, due to the nature of the poc. works or dont work. if any we need to align in the coordination meeting.

4.1 (a) as we all know, only the customized software is part of the sold software. We ask to take into account to rephrase this, so we can re-use the work done to deliver jointly to other customers. this would mean to declare the software without any "NEOM" trademarks part of the the open source stack

4.1 b see a

4.1 (c) needs to be declared which 3rd party systems are used: (e. g. bootstrap, postgresql, structr, Neo4j Enterprise Edition, keycloak, CertBot, Jhipster, Nginx, pgAdmin)

4.1 (d) since we do not know which licenses "NEOM" owns, should we install the deliverable on CCG servers and do the poc here, and avoid any hassle with licenses?

4.2. (a) these documents / contracts need to be prepared by IDEA and be delivered in time. // these paragraphs make much more sens imho after the poc in the folloing projects

4.2. (b) we are doing a small funded poc, this paragraph would put a big load on our shoulder, but we would assure, on an agreed payment to support on everything we/you/neom needs

1. as agreed, acceptance needs to be defined, so we dont have a moving traget

6/7/8/9/10 Terms I would not understand properly, which might be valid for US contracts. since I am not a lawyer I do not understand fully.
