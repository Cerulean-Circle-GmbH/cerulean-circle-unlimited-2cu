# 🚀 Dual-Context Navigation - Quick Start Guide

**⏱️ 5-minute read** | Get up and running with dual-context navigation

## What is Dual-Context Navigation?

Dual-context navigation allows you to browse this repository in **two ways simultaneously**:

1. **📁 Hierarchical** - Traditional folder structure (how you normally browse GitHub)
2. **🌐 Page-Based** - Confluence-style page IDs (great for direct linking)

Every markdown file has a navigation header that lets you instantly switch between these two views!

## How to Navigate

### Look for the Navigation Header

At the top of every markdown file, you'll see:

```
📁 Hierarchical: cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/governance/governance.md → 🌐 Page-Based: 2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/300000001/
```

### Click to Switch Context

- **📁 Click the hierarchical path** → Stay in folder structure
- **🌐 Click the page-based path** → Jump to page ID structure

### Example Navigation

Starting from `governance.md`:

```
Current: cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/governance/governance.md

Options:
1. Browse by folders → governance/cc-internals/contracts.md
2. Browse by page ID → pages/300000008/contracts.md
```

## Finding Files

### Method 1: Browse Folders (Traditional)
```
cerulean-circle-unlimited-2cu/
├── governance/
│   ├── governance.md
│   └── cc-internals/
├── product/
├── customer/
└── corporate-strategy/
```

### Method 2: Browse by Page ID
```
2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCU/pages/
├── 300000001/governance.md
├── 300000002/cc-internals.md
├── 400000001/product.md
└── 500000001/customer.md
```

### Method 3: Use Symlinks
Every page has convenient symlinks:
- `topic.entry.md` - Jump into page structure
- `topic.page.md` - Return to hierarchical structure

## Quick Tips

### 🎯 For New Users
1. Start with hierarchical browsing (it's familiar!)
2. Try clicking a 🌐 page link to see the alternative view
3. Use browser back button to return

### 🔍 For Finding Content
- **Know the topic?** → Use hierarchical path
- **Have a page ID?** → Go directly via page structure
- **Searching?** → Both structures are searchable

### ✏️ For Contributors
- New files automatically get dual-context navigation
- Just create your markdown file normally
- The system handles the rest!

## Common Actions

### Navigate to Parent
- In hierarchical view: Go up one folder
- In page view: Check the navigation header for parent

### Share a Link
- Hierarchical: Copy the GitHub URL
- Page-based: Use the page ID for permanent links

### Find Related Pages
- Look for `.entry.md` files (entry points to topics)
- Check subdirectories in both contexts
