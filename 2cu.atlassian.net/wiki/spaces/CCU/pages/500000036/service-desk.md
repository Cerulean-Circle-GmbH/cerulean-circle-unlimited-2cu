> [!INFO]
> Use the service team health monitor template to keep track of your service team's health. Keep this template in your team space and if there are any areas that you're not confident are green, dive into the plays to get back on track. For detailed facilitation instructions go to [health monitor for service teams](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/health-monitor/service-teams).

 Team health assessment

With your team, read the definition of each attribute of healthy, high-performing teams out loud. On the count of three have each person rate how they feel the team is doing compared to each definition (thumbs-up/green, thumbs-sideways/yellow, thumbs-down/red). Record the results of each attribute rating in the table. Color each cell using the following color key: HEALTHY = "We're strong here", BIT SICK = "We're ok... but a little shaky", SICK = "We're not healthy".

 Focus areas

Ask your team to collectively come up with one attribute you want to focus on. Then, call out ways to move the SICK or BIT SICK toward HEALTHY. Make sure they are actionable, specific, and measurable.
