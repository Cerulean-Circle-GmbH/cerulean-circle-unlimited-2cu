- IDEA will not opening a 1st level desk, this will be kept under CC

- Best guess: The Product Support life-cycle will be announced on the CCG Website, here will be defined the following terms:  
\- Latest version of a branch  
\- Necessity of update  
\- End of support / development / maintenance for products

Makes it sense to rename all respective WODA components into Connectors??

- We need the cfo to align with the companies and ask for an excellent offer

- Best Guess: After having seen all of these policies, we need a policy for GDPR, Impressum, AGB, EULA, Cookies, Use of Youtube (two click solution)

- Best guess, we prepare an excel sheet that combines offers (a), order (b) and delivery notification (c) together with customer (d), serial number (e) and contract (f)

- [ ] Reporting: You agree to: [Marcel Donges](https://2cu.atlassian.net/wiki/people/557058:26fa7b10-cf49-473c-81c1-fee4e574a9f7?ref=confluence) We trust everyone, right?

- As for now, we do not do audits, but this is subject for change, we need to be aware that customers having signed this without the paragraphs, might refuse this.
