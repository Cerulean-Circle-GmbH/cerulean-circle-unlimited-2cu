# Testing

This page will summarize the current methods we apply for testing, and is still in progress

Currently we are applying Manual Testing of our “to be delivered” components.

## Manual Peer Testing:

1. The developer provides a comprehensive documentation of the User Flow through the component
2. This includes a list of all planned actions and their expected behaivours
3. The planned actions are then tested and the results documented in the testing document,
  1. if succesful by checking of the checkbox,
  2. if problematic the tester will document the issue
    1. eather by providing the link to the bug in Jira
    2. or by appropriately describing the issue in the testing document and notifying the responsible developer
4. Bugs that are found are to be added to the Backlog as a bug, along with a notification via Skype/Email to the developer/s responsible for the component
