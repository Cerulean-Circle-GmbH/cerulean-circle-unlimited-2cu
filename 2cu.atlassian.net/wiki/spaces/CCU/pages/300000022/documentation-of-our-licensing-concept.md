# Documentation of our Licensing concept

As an organization that values and contributes to open source software, we understand the importance of maintaining a sustainable and thriving ecosystem for these projects. Our commitment to open source is unwavering, and we believe that the dual license model is one effective way to ensure the continued development and sustainability of the project. This model allows us to offer our software under both an open source license and a commercial license, providing flexibility and choice for users and enabling us to generate revenue to support ongoing development and innovation. We believe that this approach strikes a balance between open source ideals and the practical realities of sustaining a software project, and we remain dedicated to fostering a strong and vibrant open source community.

The Cerulean Circle Platform is distributed under a dual License to keep the source code open to anyone who is interested to learn more about WODA.

1. AGPL: You can use the Software as is but any change you do needs to feed back to the repository. This ensures that the community can benefit from any improvements or modifications made to the software.
2. Subscription based License: By receiving this license from us, you are allowed to use closed source within the Cerulean Circle Platform. You will also receive Support offerings, such as technical support, access to updates, and the ability to use the software for commercial purposes. Mention any additional features that will only be available to subscribers.
