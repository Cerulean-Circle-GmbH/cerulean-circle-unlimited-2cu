How it works:

- using the **AGPL** you can use the **woda kernel** without limitations, and use it in your environment. But you need to **publish all changes to the source code under the agpl** and making it publically available. *This means you cannot keep any customizations for yourself.*
- using the commercial license, you can use the WODA Kernel also with **private customizations**
- using the commercial license you are entitles to by **support subscriptions** and **usage subscriptions**

this means for the the copyright holder:

- describe both licenses the agpl one and the commercial one on each header of each source code file

this mean for the user of the agpl software

- all software needs to be fed back under a ACL

# Explanation

WODA Kernel the world's leading framework for Web 4.0 is offered via dual licensing.

There's the open source AGPL license and there's the commercial license.

1. The AGPL license means that you can modify, reproduce and distribute the WODA Kernel for free as long as you share your entire application with the world for free **under the same license**.
2. Still, full ownership over your creation is possible thanks to WODA Kernel commercial license. It's not free, but you do build a sustainable business, so you are no longer obligated to disclose your code or for your internal audits or IP infringements and you also get access to our dedicated support.

Cerulean Circle GmbH provides tailor made commercial agreements, contact us or our resellers to get a custom quote.

# Commercial software license and support agreements

Due to their nature, most companies cannot agree to an AGPL copyleft license. As soon as you want to **remove the AGPL copyleft** and use WODA Kernel in a closed source, proprietary environment, you have to purchase an WODA Kernel commercial license form Cerulean Circle. This will license you under our software license and support agreements.

# **EULA**

Upon Acceptance of an **Order Form** that specifies an Instance Yearly License and subject to the **terms and conditions** of this Agreement, CCG hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable nonsublicensable, fee-bearing yearly license in the **Territory (region)** to install, use and modify the WODA Kernal **on Permitted Devices** solely with respect to the number of Instances set forth in one or more **Accepted Order Forms**. Third parties, including Licensee’s Affiliates, may be granted access and use of the Licensed Software strictly for the purpose of using Licensee’s Products on Licensee’s Permitted Devices.

We have identified several organizational, legal and economic limitations and requirements, which may in practice fundamentally limit the usability of the model.

> The case studies have shown that the company as an organization needs to believe in the strong copyleft licensing model.
> 
> Moreover, GNU GPL license seems to be a viable marketing tool in dual licensing.
> 
> Legally, dual licensing requires the use of a license with a strong copyleft clause and that all legal rights to use and distribute the software are managed by a single entity.
> 
> Economic discussion discussed how an open source license may due to network effects act as an efficient user base leverage
> 
> Then, the high-end of the user base may be price discriminated with the commercial license because of their different preferences.
> 
> Finally, dual licensing may significantly reduce the costs of piracy and copyright enforcement.
