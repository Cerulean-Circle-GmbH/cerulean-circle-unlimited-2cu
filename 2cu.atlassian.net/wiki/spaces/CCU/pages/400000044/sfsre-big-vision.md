Project Supernova

a groupware kernel for business goal oriented cross domain collaboration.

Entry point of every business collaboration is the at least two fold business goal that will result in a multitude of contracts like LOI, NDA, and final Projectorder. These contracts are made from 2 or more Legal Persons acting in well defined Roles with assigned rights- and duty-policies to teach an agteed on business goal, long before all implicit details of the upcoming project are fully knowable.

The groupware tracks the journey of both parties to drill down the implicit requirements and planning process to reach the agreed upon business goal with least boiler plate work, maximum performance and transparency.

To achieve that, the groupware kernel only needs to enable a cascading task definition process attached to the cascading detailed goals that are achieved by creating versioned artefacts as deliverables in an evermore detailing quality and accuracy. the task description artefacts result in messages to the required legal persons that contain all input artefacts required to produce the next delivery artefact in a secure fully traceable environment always in the context to the original upmost business goal.

Thet ultimate goal of the platform is to provide the investors the best performing real estate fonds ever in a fully digital seamless iPhone or in rhis case iFonds user experience.
