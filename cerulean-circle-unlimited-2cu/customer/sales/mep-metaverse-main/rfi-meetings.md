Abdul: lack of understanding of MV AND convince the gov mindsets to see the necessity

Abdul: is the MV dying down?

Anthony: Nooo, there are cycles, that is always coming on, ecommerce, social media, next step after the ‚Äúflat web‚Äù, Apple is the sleeping lion, coming up with s/th great

Abdul: (headsets + ecosystem)?

Marcel: there is a hurdle to get into the MV: how to lower the entry hurdle; therefore put it on any device in the browser, The transition is lacking; CC is having the software on any device

Abdul: Do we have the right team? Are we missing anything?

Judd: Cerulean with Team, cavrn.us with Teams, World Expo, having SME, we can get to other companies to get the needed know how

Marcel: we can provide migration to the DC, it‚Äôs a large amount in the budget

Gunther: create a supposal, each one creates his own proposal

Anthony: Experience, Creation, Content, Tourist Attractions,

debrief

\-

GS

- rfi is worth nothing
- idea does not know about approach
- [cavrn.us](http://cavrn.us) is doing their own stuff
- judd is afraid to ask for the money
- therefore:
  - submit our own proposal
  - idea will do the design work
  - they need ROI - [cavrn.us](http://cavrn.us) does not care
  - salvage : we submit own proposal

Defining the Ask

Understanding the Incentives

Understanding the problems with the incentives

What kind of experiences can be done

What is the return of investment

Applying to real use cases

MD: defining the ask is understanding the incentives discovering the problems with the incentives What kind of civic and business use cases ROI

Design: 300000/500000
