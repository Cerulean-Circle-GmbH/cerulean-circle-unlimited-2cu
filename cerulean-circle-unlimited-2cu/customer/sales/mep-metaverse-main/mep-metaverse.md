# MEP Metaverse

# Introduction:

The World Economic Forum (WEF) launched a major Metaverse initiative called the Global Collaboration Village (GCV), a purpose-driven metaverse where organizations can convene to learn about, create solutions for, and take action on the world’s most pressing challenges. Saudi Arabia announced during the Annual meeting in Davos 2023, that it will become a pioneering partner in the Global Collaboration Village along with 80 other states and institutions. The Royal Court order #**44404899** has accorded the approval for building a Saudi House as part of the GCV with the Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP) leading those efforts for KSA.

The objective of the Saudi House is to provide a next-generation metaverse ecosystem for residents, tourists, visitors, investors, local government, and other potential stakeholders. The Virtual Saudi House should be a standalone metaverse integrated with the WEF Metaverse which involves various government/private entities. The following summarizes the purpose of WEF’s Global Collaboration project:

The initial phase of the Saudi village will be focusing on a few key identified use cases, however the vision for the Saudi village extends to where it will host live events, provide services integrated with government 2D services as a single point-of-service, teleport freely around the metaverse so that they can participate in groups and join (and potentially pay for) events, and provide many other value-added services.

The initial objectives of the Saudi Village include:

·       Providing Immersive Tourism for various sites especially the historical ones

·       Become a prime location for Networking & corporate events

·       Seamlessly host cultural events and virtual conferences/exhibitions/consultations

·       Provide Governmental services

·       Enable Digital twins of future developments

The project aims to Leverage on on-demand domain and design expertise, digital accelerators, and ready-to-apply use cases and templates that can expedite the delivery of unique experiences. The bidder must provide a Metaverse as a Service (MaaS) solution and the project scope will cover the experiences end-to-end from requirements analysis, design, development, deployment, and operations support.

The initial concept will be Inspired by ALDARIYA, where the Virtual Saudi Village will have a market where visitors can walk through to explore different cultural experiences, products, and learn more about this amazing country. Visitors will be able to enter town mud houses, in additions to allowing them to visit various attractions which may include the following:

·       Giga projects future state tours (NEOM, Red Sea, etc.)

·       Tourist attractions (e.g. Rejal Almaa Village) and regional aspects and Ancient Art

·       Religious places including Masjid Al Haram

·       The M-Investment HUB

·       The Saudi Embassy

·       An Entertainment and sports Valley

·       AlUla Old Twon and Owasis

·       A Town hall to hold events from reality to the Metaverse
