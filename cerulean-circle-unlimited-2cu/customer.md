 Impact assessment criteria

üßêInstructions to fill out the table below

1. Levels or tiers can be used to divide changes into segments based on your organization's risk tolerance. Weight these items to meet your business needs or use an AND/OR approach.
2. Avoid bias when assessing the customer impact and try to use actual examples from past similar changes. *Always err on the side of greater impact.*
3. Consider at least 3 areas of your business where you want to avoid any disruption, such as finances, public relations, and customer experience.
4. For each area of your business, define thresholds of risk that will be used to weight the change effort in the next step.

 Roles and responsibilities

üßêInstructions to fill out the table below

1. You can use a different set of approvers for different types of changes or funnel all changes through the same process. The important thing is to avoid any bottlenecks so changes don't get stalled in the approval stage unnecessarily.
2. Be sure you share the impact assessment and an executive summary of the change with each approver. This will speed up the review process and give approvers confidence in the level of rigor you used to assess and understand changes.
3. Ensure you have a backup process for changes that need to be executed quickly, since some approvers may be out of the office or unavailable.
