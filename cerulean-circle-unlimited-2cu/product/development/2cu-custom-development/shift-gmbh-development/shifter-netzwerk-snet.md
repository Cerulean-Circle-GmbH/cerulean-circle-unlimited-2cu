# Shifter Netzwerk (SNET)

## The Aim of the System:

The Shifter Netzwerk should enable interested parties, customers, and dealers to form a network for using and getting to comprehend shift products. An example of this would be the possibility for interested parties to have a certain device demonstrated live by other customers who already have such a device.

Furthermore, technically inexperienced people are to be brought together with experienced people to support the repairs of their Shift devices.

In addition to the pure private individuals, dealers can also use this network to get potential customers into their business or to offer repairs.

Collection points for old hardware who is not included in our deposit system should also be offered.

## Ideology / Rules

1. Safety (meeting in public places and not alone)
2. Honesty (not talking about devices nicely, but also not badly)
3. Mutual appreciation

## Consumer

1. **Prospectively** registered person/user without an offered service (with or without hardware)
2. **Private Shifter**
  1. **Ambassador** who helps others with questions or shows his device
  2. **Supporter** helps regarding the handling of devices
  3. **Repair** helps others repair their devices
  4. **Return** collects old devices and accessories e.g. in a public or non-public box
3. **Business Shifter** marked as a company (can also offer services such as repair and recycling)
  1. **Ambassador** who helps others with questions or shows his device
  2. **Supporter** helps regarding the handling of devices
  3. **Repair** helps others repair their devices
  4. **Return** collects old devices and accessories e.g. in a public or non-public box
  5. **Dealer** is selling Shift products

## Idea

- The system is rebuilt with ONCE + jHipster Server
- Basic function:
  - What offers are there near me? (Map + list of shifters)
  - Filters on devices and services (view, repair, etc.)
  - Private Shifter are rewarded with a bonus for their services
  - Messanger to contact service Provider
- A user always has a private address
- A user can have up to 5 addresses where he can meet with interested parties. These meeting points can optionally be shared on the map.
- User can customize meeting points (e.g. for travel, holidays, assembly, etc.)
- Validation of email (double opt-in), phone number via SMS?

## Delimitation

- No platform for Messaging between Prospectors. Only Prospectively to the service provider.

## Nonfunctional requirements

- In 1 - 5 years
  - Registered user up to 10K
  - Peat load based on the experience of TV Shows accesses
- In 5 - 10 years
  - Registered user up to 50K
  - Peat load based on the experience of TV Shows accesses \* 5

## General questions

- How to handle international translation? German in the first place. English later on.
- How to provide the option for feedback?

[Figma combined Document](https://www.figma.com/file/wJyh9tIUpPpqSbqLVgwinT/Shifter-Netzwerk-Proto)

## Map:

- On the left a list with all the offers shown on the map
- When you focus, the offer is highlighted on the map and in the list
- The filter restricts the selection on the map and list
- It is possible to directly start a conversation based on a service provider
- The company address is shown on the map
- In case the user is not logged on he can see the map and search
- In case of an overload (TV show), a tutorial video on youtube should be shown

### GUI Points

- The map is accessible without a login
- Favorites are displayed with stars
- In the map backend design, the colors should be changed
- The result list is limited to 20 results
- Design of an Element on the map
  - The color indicates private / customer service
  - In the icon, the device(s) shall be shown
  - At the borders, the provided services shall be shown
- Liquid browsing
  - No grouping is used on the map.
  - At a close zoom level, the full icon with services is shown.
  - The icons are getting smaller if zoom out
  - At some point, the icons change to only colored pixel
  - There are two ways of Navigation
    - Navi mode
      - The navigation is normal ( move and zoom)
      - The century mark my actual position
      - The result in the list is shown depending on the distance to my position
      - A circuit around my position is shown to indicating the search range
      - If the map moves my position changes as well and the result list is created new
    - Selection mode **(later)**
      - The circuit is created manually on the map
      - Another way of moving is needed
