# Test suite

### Testing Component (TC)

Points

- Another Component can be dropped on the TC. This starts the analysis process.
- There are different Views
  - View with CLI Output
  - View with formatted output
  - Graphical Output?
- Tests should be grouped together
- Helping/explanation text for the tests
- Tests should contain warnings for **good practice**
- Function who runs **silent tests**. (return true/false)
- Action for testing should be available for all Component actions
- Additional defined Component tests defined in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) are also started
- It should be possible to check parts of the tree
