> [!TIP]
> - Now arm64 (Mac) and amd64 images are available.
> - Your personal SSH key is automatically integrated if located correctly
> - Your git name and email is automatically integrated if located correctly
> - The source code in `/var/dev/EAMD.ucp` is in a separate volume or in a directory you can choose.
>   - Restarting and recreating the container → changes will be preserved
>   - Deleting the volume `once_once-development` → changes will be lost
>   - Only on MAC or Linux you could map a local directory instead of the volume
