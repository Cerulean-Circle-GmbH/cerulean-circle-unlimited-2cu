## What is ONCE

ONCE is the first M2M kernel. It realises for the first time the paradigm shift for a runtime environment that at first support the need of machine to machine communication (M2M) before Human Machine Interaction (HMI) as all other current operating systems do.  
Machines are enabled to discover each other without knowing each other before and start to build up a communication relationship that enables seamless interaction between the machines. Machines are Things, that are software enabled - thus having an embedded touring machine inside or attached via a digital twin.  
ONCE can discover these touring machines, load them and execute them on the fly, this it is an M2M operating system……
