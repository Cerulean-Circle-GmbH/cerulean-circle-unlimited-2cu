# New Idea

- create a scripted video with Till Gunter Marcel
- send this to all people to the groups or our multipliers
- tell the people how they can reach us

> [!NOTE]
> Marcel: We have a simple solution for an "event" - We record our own live demo in a video, post it on a private YouTube page, and then send the link in the private groups.
> So we don't do any live audience stuff, we just do the video and send it.
> The theme of the video then would be "Simulate the future before you build it" and we obviously run through the 5 uses cases.
> I'll write a script that lasts about 10 mins, and have parts where you and Till are brought in to narrate.
