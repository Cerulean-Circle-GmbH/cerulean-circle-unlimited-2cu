# Preamble

The parties to the contract intend to cooperate in various projects for customers of the client. This framework contract provides the full and final framework for this cooperation. If the parties to the contract have already concluded any other contractual provisions at the time when this framework contract is agreed, these provisions shall be replaced by this framework contract.

# Object of the contract

(1) The supplier shall render the services defined in the relevant individual contracts in the client's projects. It shall be entitled to deploy either freelance or employed personnel to render the services. The deployment of each member of the personnel shall require the prior approval of the client.

(2) The parties to the contract shall agree on the content, extent, dates and remuneration of each of the services to be rendered and the names of the personnel to be deployed in individual contracts. A template for such individual contracts is attached to this framework contract as Appendix 1.

(3) The supplier's personnel shall not be subject to instructions issued by the client and shall be free to determine their own working hours. The supplier undertakes to take the requirements of the client's project into account as far as possible when defining the working hours for its personnel.

(4) The supplier shall accept full liability for the proper and timely fulfilment of the individual contracts. This shall also apply to auxiliary or substitute personnel insofar as they are deployed by the supplier. The supplier shall ensure that all of its deployed personnel have the necessary residence and work permits for their work in the project location. If any claims are made against the client due to any violation of this obligation to obtain permits, the supplier indemnifies the client in advance from any claims which may arise.

(5) This agreement does not imply any obligation of the client to commission services or any obligation of the supplier to render services.

# Area of validity of the framework contract

(1) This framework contract shall apply to all individual orders throughout its duration. It shall also apply even if it is not explicitly referred to in the individual order.

(2) Insofar as any agreements are made in the individual contracts which deviate from the provisions of this framework contract, the provisions of the individual contract shall take priority over the provisions of the framework contract.

# Confidentiality agreement

(1) Definition of "information": all documents, specifications, designs, plans, drawings, software materials, data, samples or prototypes in written, spoken or electronically recorded form and any abstract information such as business ideas or concepts which either party may disclose to the other party shall be referred to hereinafter as "information". Information shall also especially, but not exclusively, cover daily rates, order volumes or any other commercial information which has been agreed between the parties to the contract.

(2) Definition of "customers": any business company or other legal entity with which one of the parties to the contract demonstrably maintains business relations as a supplier or with which the parties to the contract act in a marketing capacity or are engaged in joint order negotiations shall hereinafter be referred to as "customers".

(3) Each party to the contract undertakes to maintain confidentiality with regard to all information about customers, projects, products and internal procedures of the other party which has been gained in any conversations and the mutual cooperation between the parties, only to use such information for the purpose of the mutual cooperation and not to make it accessible to any third parties. This shall especially, but not exclusively, apply to the agreed daily rates between LionGate and the supplier.

(4) Insofar as the information is made available to the personnel of the parties to the contract, the parties shall ensure that such personnel sign an agreement which corresponds to this confidentiality agreement in its content.

(5) The obligation to maintain secrecy shall not apply to any information which a party to the contract demonstrably already knew before the start of the cooperation. Nor shall it apply to any information which becomes public knowledge during the cooperation if this is demonstrably not caused by the parties to the contract.

(6) The parties to the contract undertake to keep secure all documents and records and any duplicates and copies thereof, to destroy them or hand them over to an authorised representative of the other party at any time on demand, and to do this even without any demand when the cooperation ends. This shall also apply to any information saved in electronic form. Any right of retention of such documents, records, duplicates and copies is excluded

(7) The parties to the contract shall be mutually liable for any loss or damage which results from any violation of this confidentiality agreement.

(8) In the event of any violation of any of the obligations arising from the above sub-sections, the violating party shall be obliged to pay a contractual penalty commensurate with the degree of negligence or intent, which shall be set by the party suffering the violation and shall be determined in the event of a dispute by the court responsible for cases of this type in the place of jurisdiction. However, the contractual penalty shall be at least 2,000. - ‚Ç¨ for each case. The contractual penalty shall be due for payment on the day after the violation of the confidentiality agreement.

# Customer protection

(1) For the duration of the contract the supplier grants customer protection to the client.

(2) For the duration of this contract the supplier undertakes not to enter any contractual relationship with companies which are in direct competition with CCG in any specific projects (Conflict of interests) unless a violation of the legal or economic interests of the client need not be anticipated in the specific case in spite of the existing competition situation, and on condition that the client agrees to this exception.

(3) If the client deploys the supplier's personnel to work for its customers, the supplier undertakes not to make any competing offers to these customers during the project period and for 6 months after the end of the project in the areas of responsibility of these projects in which the supplier's personnel are or have been involved, and not to take any other actions which interfere with the relationship between the client and its customers. This shall not apply if the contractual relationship between the customer and LionGate is terminated for reasons for which the supplier is not responsible. The areas of responsibility shall be stipulated in the individual contracts.

(4) The obligations under ¬ß 4 sub-section (2) and (3) shall not apply if the supplier was already in a demonstrable business relationship with the client's respective customer at the time when the cooperation began. Furthermore, the parties to the contract shall be entitled to agree different provisions for individual orders.

(5) In the event of any violation of any of the obligations arising from the above sub-sections, the violating party shall be obliged to pay a contractual penalty commensurate with the degree of negligence or intent, which shall be set by the party suffering the violation and shall be determined in the event of a dispute by the court responsible for cases of this type in the place of jurisdiction. However, the contractual penalty shall be at least 2,000. - ‚Ç¨ for each case. The contractual penalty shall be due for payment on the day after the violation of the customer protection provisions.

# Remuneration

(1) The amount of the remuneration and the method used to calculate it shall be defined for each individual order in an individual contract.

(2) The supplier shall provide the client with regular invoices for the services rendered; the invoices shall comply with the applicable, statutory provisions, and they shall correctly state the turnover tax (VAT) included in the amount.

(3) In time and materials projects, the invoice shall be submitted monthly with a record of the time worked, and in fixed price projects the invoice shall be submitted after the acceptance of the required performance has been declared in writing by the client's respective customer.

(4) The payment period shall be 30 days in all cases. No discounts or deductions shall be granted. Any mutual offsetting of the amounts payable is excluded.

(5) All payments arising from the contractual relationship between the parties shall be made by bank transfer to the bank accounts which each party shall designate.

(6) All expenses and auxiliary costs - especially reimbursement of travelling expenses etc. ‚Äì shall be deemed to be covered by the agreed remuneration.

(7) The supplier shall pay its own taxes and other charges and contributions. If any claims are made against the client by the tax authorities, the social insurance institutions or other entitled recipients for these or similar taxes or charges, the supplier undertakes to indemnify the client against any such costs.

(8) In addition, the supplier shall obtain the necessary insurance (Accident insurance, liability insurance) and bear the costs resulting from this insurance.

# Duration of the contract

(1) This contract shall come into force when it is signed; it is concluded for an indefinite period. It can be terminated by either party to the contract at the end of a month, subject to one month's notice.

(2) Insofar as the parties to the contract have concluded individual contracts for a duration which exceeds the duration of this framework contract, the provisions of this framework contract shall continue to apply to the relevant individual contracts until they are finally fulfilled.

# Property rights and expertise

(1) The supplier shall be obliged to notify the client in writing of all inventions made in connection with the implementation of the individual contracts and this framework contract.

(2) The client shall be entitled to use any property rights of the supplier which have been obtained in the framework of this contract without charge. The payment of the remuneration for the individual contracts shall cover all license fees which may arise. The client and its customers shall be entitled to pass on usage rights.

(3) All documents and records produced by the supplier in the framework of the individual contracts such as programs, reports, descriptions, tapes etc. shall be the property of the client or its customers. The client shall have an exclusive and unlimited right to use or transmit this material.

# Office, working materials and materials provided by the client

(1) Both two parties to the contract assume that each party shall render its performance with its own working materials, without using any working materials of the other party

# Concluding provisions

(1) All alterations to this agreement must be agreed in writing. This also applies to any changes to this requirement of written form. No supplementary agreements have been made by word of mouth.

(2) The place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this agreement is Munich. German law shall apply. Insofar as international law is to apply, this shall nevertheless exclude uniform UN commercial law.

(3) Insofar as any individual provisions of this agreement are invalid or incomplete, this shall not affect the validity of the other provisions. Regarding the invalid or incomplete elements, the parties undertake to agree a replacement or supplementary provision which comes as close as possible to the meaning and economic purpose of the invalid or incomplete provision.
